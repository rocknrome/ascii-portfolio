Learn Git_Project_ASCII Portfolio
1.The ASCII face in portrait.txt had a goatee in the last commit, but it was deleted in the working directory. Taking a second look, you want the goatee back.
Discard changes in the working directory for portrait.txt.
$ git checkout HEAD portrait.txt
2.That’s much better! Now, give your portrait some eyebrows. It’s up to you how to do it. One way is to use a few = symbols on the line above the eyes, like this: 

  ===       ===
  O           O


Save.
3.Add the file to the staging area.
$ git add portrait.txt 
4.Make a commit.
$ git commit -m "First Commit"
5.It looks like every file has its date written incorrectly.
Change the completion dates on every file, clicking Save after each change.
6.Next, add all your changes to the staging area with a single command.
$ git add portrait.txt house.txt tree.txt 
7.Make a commit.
$ git commit -m "Second Commit"
8.You forgot to add your “artist name” to each file. Under the date, include the name:

L. Da Vinci

Save
9.If you know you want to add every file in the working directory to the staging area, instead of adding each file individually, you can use a shortcut:

git add .


The . means “all files”. Adding files to the staging area with . is faster than specifying each file individually, but it's easy to accidentally add files you don’t want there. Make sure you always know what you’re adding.
$ git add.
10.It turns out that house.txt is an experiment and doesn’t belong in the commit you’re staging. Reset the staging area to remove house.txt. 
$ git reset HEAD house.txt
11.Now make a commit. 
$ git commit -m "Third Commit"
